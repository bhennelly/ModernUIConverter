# ModernUIConverter
Acumatica tool to convert win form aspx pages to new modern UI files


This tool is not intended to completely convert all classic pages to the new modern UI. The intent here is to save some time by running this tool to create the ts and html file from the old aspx file as starting points. 

Currently panels are not converted but most other entities will convert in some way but as mentioned still require changes to complete the conversion.
